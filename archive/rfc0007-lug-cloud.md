# 1 Purpose

The /etc/init.d/cloud will provide a PaaS solution for LUG and potentially ACM members. This can help attract more members as well as give our current members a platform to deploy applications on.

# 2 Governance

The /etc/init.d subgroup shall be administered by a council of its members making decisions based on majority votes of those in attendance when the vote is held.

# 3 Meetings

Meetings will be held at least bi-weekly, typically on Tuesdays.

# 4 Projects

Create a cloud of virtual machines and/or containers for LUG and possibly ACM members. The software chosen can vary from year to year as appropriate and relevant software is found. Documentation will be kept on LUG's wiki.
