# 1 Purpose

This group exists to give LUG members a place to learn and explore new programming languages and concepts that will not necessarily be encountered in classes. The main goal should be to learn a programming language that is in some way conceptually different from the standard languages learned in classes at UIC. 

# 2 Governance

This group shall be run by a council of all it's members. All decisions will be made by a majority vote of members present when the vote is called.
