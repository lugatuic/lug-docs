## 1 Organization Name

This organization shall be known as the Linux User's Group or "LUG" for short. Throughout this document the organization will be referred to by its acronym, LUG.

## 2 Objective

The objective of this organization is to promote the understanding of and participation in the free software and open source communities.

## 3 Membership

### 3.1 Eligibility

It is the policy of the University of Illinois at Chicago  to not engage in discrimination or harassment against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, disability, sexual orientation including gender identity, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran and will comply with all federal and state nondiscrimination, equal opportunity and affirmative action laws, orders and regulations.

### 3.2 Standing

A member in the organization can be in good or poor standing. By default members are in good standing upon joining the organization.

A member in good standing has all the rights and privileges granted to that member by this document. To remain in good standing a member must:

- Contribute to meetings and activities
- Uphold and complete all duties and responsibilities assigned them as members

It is the responsibility of the Executive Committee to track and decide on the standing of members.

Penalties for members in poor standing shall be drafted and maintained by the Executive Committee.

### 3.3 Tiers

There are three membership types organized into two tiers. These tiers are University and Alumni. The three membership types are University-Active and University-Passive under the University tier and Alumni under the Alumni tier.

#### 3.3.1 University Tier

Membership in both University type tiers is open to any current student, faculty, or staff of UIC.

There are two types of membership under the University tier: University-Active and University-Passive.

For a member in good standing to switch between the two types of University Tier membership the member must submit a request to the Traditional Officers at least 24 hours prior to the next scheduled Executive Committee vote so that there is time to change any necessary records. If the request comes within 24 hours before the next Executive Committee vote then it will not take effect until after the vote.

##### 3.3.1.1 University-Active

University-Active tier membership exists for those members who want the privileges and responsibilities of being an active voting member of the LUG.

##### 3.3.1.2 University-Passive

University-Passive membership exists to allow individuals to enjoy full benefits of being a member of the LUG but do not want the responsibility of being a voting member involved in the administration of the club.

#### 3.3.2 Alumni Tier

Alumni membership is open to any former student, faculty, or staff of UIC. Who during their studies or employment at the University was a member of one of the University tier types of membership.

Any university tier member in good standing who leaves the University is automatically converted to Alumni membership until the member chooses to leave the LUG.

### 3.4 Dues

The Executive Committee shall have the right to levy fair annual dues for membership.

All University tier members must pay these dues or risk falling into poor standing or potential expulsion from the organization at the discretion of the Executive Committee.

Alumni members shall be exempt from any dues.

### 3.5 Handling of Funds

The President and Treasurer are financially responsible. These officers will be the only members allowed to access the COF account. The advisor may not be the third officer. All funds raised on campus MUST be deposited into the organizationâ€™s on-campus Chicago Organization Fund account.

### 3.6 Expulsion

A member may be expelled from the LUG for any or all of the following reasons:

- Stealing or abuse of funds
- Physical or verbal abuse of members
- Any gross misconduct as so deemed by the Executive Committee

In order for a member to be expelled a majority vote must be obtained from the Executive Committee. This vote will be held over the course of seven days to give members ample time to consider their decision and vote. At the end of the voting period votes will be tallied and the necessary action will be taken.

## 4 Executive Committee

The Executive Committee shall be the primary governing body of the LUG. It will conduct, on behalf of the LUG, all business it deems necessary and consist of three sets: Traditional Officers, Non-Traditional Officers, and The Vox.

### 4.1 Voting and Quorum

All voting matters shall be decided by a majority vote of a quorum of at least 2/3 of the Executive Committee, one of the present members voting must not be a traditional officer, so long as such a member exists, with the exception of any process which this document describes should be decided by some other process.

### 4.2 Offices and Officers

Officer positions in the LUG may be created and destroyed at the will of the Executive Committee by a standard vote as described in the *Voting and Quorum* section with exception to the three UIC required positions as described in the section *Traditional Officers*.

All officers shall have a term of one calender year starting on the day elected.

No officer, traditional or otherwise, has any more decision making power than any other member of the Executive Committee. The purpose of officers in the LUG is to keep things organized, documented, and to help ensure that the LUG stays on track of its goals as decided by the Executive Committee. They do not hold power akin to leaders in other organizations unless granted that power by the Executive Committee. Because of this power structure there is no term limit on any office in the organization.

### 4.3 Traditional Officers

There shall be three offices which must be filled each calendar year by University tier members of the LUG. These positions are required by the university and so therefore must be filled. These positions are President, Vice-President, Treasurer, and Secretary. Each position may be filled by one person and one person only. This person must not have any other Traditional Officer position.

#### 4.3.1 President

The president's duties are as follows:

- Ensure that the organization upholds the principals laid down in this document and in any further governing document created by the Executive Committee.
- To be an easy point of contact for people inside and outside the organization on matters related to the organization.
- Monitor and track progress of goals set for the LUG by the Executive Committee.

#### 4.3.2 Vice-President

The Vice-President shares the same duties as the President and it should be decided shortly after election how best to divide those duties between the two officers.

#### 4.3.3 Treasurer  

The Treasurer's duties are as follows:

- Ensure the creation of a budget by the Executive Committee, shortly after elections, for the next year.
- Monitor the budget of the organization and assure it is spent appropriately.
- Keep track of all money coming into and leaving the organization

#### 4.3.4 Secretary  

The Secretary's duties are as follows:

- Prepare formal communications with CS Department including reservations for events
- Check status of research, project, and interest groups
- Support President with event creation and administration of events
- Design and print fliers for upcoming events
- Create sponsorship proposals and reach out to companies about potential partnerships

#### 4.3.5 Alumni Advisor

- Must be an Alumni Status Member
- Be available as a resource to the other Traditional officers
- Support endeavors of Traditional officers
- Has the power of Tie Breaker vote should Traditional officers vote turn out to be a tie
- Should impeachment of an officer be requested my member, the Alumni Officer shall oversee proceedings

### 4.4 Non-Traditional Officers

Any University tier member or User Group may be appointed by the Executive Committee as a non-traditional officer in order to oversee or administer some important process for the LUG.

### 4.5 The Vox

The Vox consists of all University-Active members of the LUG who are in good standing and who are not officers in the LUG, traditional or otherwise, as their position already guarantees them a vote. Each member of the LUG has the same say in decision making as anyone else and to further that point this document explicitly creates The Vox as a part of the Executive Committee. This freedom and power also means members have a high responsibility to participate to the fullest amount they can in the goings on of the LUG.

## 5 Executive Committee Decisions

Any proposal brought to, or decision made by the Executive Committee should be drafted in the form a document called a Request For Comments, or RFC for short, as a nod to the IETF RFC standards approval process.

RFCs should be relatively short well thought out descriptions of some policy, rule, or regulation proposed to the Executive Committee. This system exist to ensure there is a well documented history of Executive Committee decisions for reference on future actions.

All approved RFCs must be kept somewhere publicly accessible to all members of the LUG.

Any RFC which modifies, even temporarily, a policy that exists in another RFC must contain a reference to that RFC so that one can easily cross reference RFCs. The modified RFC must then be annotated with a reference to this change and the new RFC. Any RFC found by the Executive Committee to violate this rule is immediately invalidated until the RFC is corrected and re-voted on.

The Executive Committee shall hold a standard vote to decide on all proposed RFCs.

This document may be used as a stylistic guide for the format of RFCs. All RFCs should be given a unique identifying number incrementing from zero.

## 6 User Groups

User groups are sub-units of the LUG devoted to some business of interest to one or more members of the LUG. User groups can be created for any purpose whether it be a general discussion group, a group in charge of administering some business of the LUG, or anything else the members desire. Groups exist to have a framework for members of the LUG to self-organize and participate in and enrich the LUG community.

No member in good standing may be excluded from a group that that individual wishes to join.

There are two tiers of LUG User Group: Unofficial and Official.

### 6.1 Unofficial Groups

Unofficial User Groups may be formed by any member(s) in good standing of the LUG at any time. Those wishing to create the group should gather together and write a document defining what the group is, what it will do, and how it will be run. This document should be iteratively improved over time with the eventual goal of it becoming the official proposal for this unofficial group to become an official group.

Unofficial groups may be granted funds by the Executive Committee upon request but are not guaranteed an annual budget.

### 6.2 Official Groups

Official User Groups are official sub-groups of the LUG. Any University tier member in good standing may submit a proposal to the Executive Committee to create an Official User Group. This proposal should come in the form of an official RFC and describe what the group is, what it will do, and how it will be run.

Official User Groups are to be allotted an annual budget by the Executive Committee.

Official User Groups are expected to keep careful record of their finances, membership, and activities. Representatives of each group will prepare a report of the status of the group, which should include the information kept in the required group records described above, each year to the executive committee.

## 7 Meetings

There are two meetings that the LUG most hold each year. These meetings must happen in the spring semester and should occur within two weeks of the previous year's meeting of that type. The Traditional Officers shall be responsible for scheduling and running these meetings.

The meetings are the Election Meeting and the Budget Meeting.

At the Election Meeting the Executive Committee shall hold a vote for each of the Traditional Officer positions as well as any Non-traditional Officer Positions that were created and deemed to require an election to appoint.

At the Budget Meeting the Executive Committee will vote to approve the LUG's annual budget as drafted by the Treasurer with input from other Executive Committee members. This meeting must take place after the Election Meeting but before the end of the semester in which the Election Meeting took place.

## 8 Advisor

The LUG shall enlist the assistance of an adviser on all projects. The LUG adviser shall be a full-time faculty member at UIC.

## 9 Amendments and Revisions

This document may be altered by a vote of the Executive Committee. To pass any alteration a 2/3 majority vote must be taken of 3/4 of the Executive Committee.
